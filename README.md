## Visualizing the coordinates of slow dippers as given by Schmidt 2021

The paper by Schmidt (doi: 10.3847/1538-3881/ac3416) got me wondering as to how compact the observed clustering of slow-dippers was. Thus I created this program to help me visualize it.

## Typical result

This is in fact the standard result (as I have chosen to define it). Though I highly recommend running the script for your self, since three dimensions rarely translate well through a two dimensional picture.
